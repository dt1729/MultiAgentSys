# P4 examples

## Pre-requisites

To run these examples you need to have installed both `p4c` and `behavioural-model` with **P4Runtime** support.

You can follow the guide provided by *p4.org*.

* `p4c`: you need to install the P4 compiler following [this guide](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c)
* `behavioural-model`: you need to install `simple_switch_grpc` following [this guide](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/tree/master/targets/simple_switch_grpc) (remember to install also **P4Runtime**)

Alternatively, you can use the [ONF script](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/blob/master/tools/dev/p4vm/install-p4-tools.sh) that should install both `p4c` and `behavioural-model` with support to P4Runtime.
