# Multi-agent system simulation and strategies for USV
 This repository simulates control strategies for multi-surface vehicle control using gazebo for WAM-V vehicles.

## TODOs:
- Deploy controllers for individual USVs
- Try different co-operation strategies
- Implement networking in the system
- Try implement localisation and mapping
